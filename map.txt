Quick Bite. 

|| Brainstorming
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
??? change purpose of app? get ip, city, top 5 restaurants without directions

get user's geolocation (lat/long)
   potentially serve HTML file and ask user to allow geolocation
   wifi trilateration (determine device location based on its distance from several WiFi access points)
OR 
   ask user to manually enter their address, and check for errors

seeder to populate DB with restaurants/ use Yelp or other API 

SQL query for 5 closest restaurants 

Print restaurant names to terminal, user has option to select one or esc

Google Maps walking directions listed for restaurants if close (30min walking?)
   if no restaurants in walking distance, print err 
   or if <5 are within walking distance

   list restaurants, give directions to restaurant 
quickbite
   [1,2,3,4,5, esc]
quickbite 1 (2 | 3 | 4 | 5)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Original plan isn't efficient- difficulty of determining user's exact address to provide walking directions,
also doesn't really seem like the best use case for a CLI

What would be useful and make sense?


Donation app
  Pick from list of charities to donate to that are devoted to ending hunger
  Get geolocation and show local food pantries to volunteer at (food banks on Google)
     Rough approximation then allow user to override it via input

Fitness tracker
  count calories
  set reminders, calendar alerts
  
Tell you how healthy something is?
  Choose from list of options
  Count calories, give percentages
  Enter height/ weight/ etc and say this is X amount of what you need for today

Something with geolocation
  Inaccurate, so just find out city/ state
  Healthiest restaurants in the city

Simple recipes app
  Give simple, cheap, healthy recipes to users
  Ask what they're in the mood for, or wildcard
  less than 10 steps? less than X USD?

Compare what's healthier?
  Pizza vs kale, kale vs oranges

Build a burger (or pizza or salad)

Or, try to use different method of geolocation (wifi, html5) other than ip for original idea





options, flags?
--help cannot be overridden

sound effects?
animations?

>I can't believe it works... I was disheartened when IP wasn't giving my true geolocation,
and thought doing something odd with HTML5 through a browser would defeat my exercise
in using NodeJS to get location. But I wondered how Google Maps gets my true location online,
found out they use WiFi trilateration, and easily implemented it

Reverse geocoding (address lookup)

Err handling for getAddress, node-fetch, try catch vs Promise.catch
  solved: another catch directly following 'then' calls after calling fetch
 

                                                                                            yes: rl.close()
                                                                                          /
                    yes: rl.close()           valid address: format and ask user to confirm -- no: go back and reprompt for address
                  /                         /
  Address detected -- no: prompt for address 
                  

street address validation: gotchas 


Give Google Maps credit in README

Problem: need inquirer to reprompt if user enters invalid input
        synchronous for loop, async await inquirer not working- the sync loop just blows through
        getting promise/callback to work inside switch case, with a loop (continuously prompt user until valid address submitted)
        trying wrapping switch-case with async function, each promise block as own function, putting in own module for readability
          keeping track of state- how deep in inquirer we are, user input address, y/n confirmation, final return value of valid address
      
        !! not working- trying other solution from stackoverflow, create inquirer submenus as own module, main as own module, call in each other instead of using switch-case
           any of the inquirer modules can be called from anywhere
        (prompts as separate functions that call each other, instead of while or for loops or switch-case)

        ERROR: OUTPUT IS SAME FORMATTED ADDRESS, REGARDLESS OF INPUT
          solution: passing value of wrong function (yes confirmation instead of address to be validated)
