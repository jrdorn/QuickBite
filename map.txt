Quick Bite. 

|| Purpose
>>>>>>>>
??? change purpose of app? get ip, city, top 5 restaurants without directions

get user's geolocation (lat/long)
   ? potentially serve HTML file? And ask user to allow geolocation
OR 
   ask user to manually enter their address, and check for errors

seeder to populate DB with restaurants/ use Yelp or other API 

SQL query for 5 closest restaurants 

Print restaurant names to terminal, user has option to select one or esc

Google Maps walking directions listed for restaurants if close (30min walking?)
   if no restaurants in walking distance, print err 
   or if <5 are within walking distance

   list restaurants, give directions to restaurant

   [1,2,3,4,5, esc]
quickbite 1 (2 | 3 | 4 | 5)
>>>>>>>

Original plan isn't efficient- difficulty of determining user's exact address to provide walking directions,
also doesn't really seem like the best use case for a CLI


What would be useful and make sense?

Fitness tracker
  count calories
  set reminders, calendar alerts
  
Tell you how healthy something is?
  Choose from list of options
  Count calories, give percentages
  Enter height/ weight/ etc and say this is X amount of what you need for today

Something with geolocation
  Inaccurate, so just find out city/ state
  Healthiest restaurants in the city








options, flags?
--help cannot be overridden
